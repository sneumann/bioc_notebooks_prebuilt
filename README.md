## Launching Bioconductor Vignettes on binder

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sneumann/bioc_notebooks_prebuilt/master)

Binder allows to run the content of GitHub repositories as Jupyter Notebooks 
on a Binder service, such as mybinder.org. Building the Bioconductor
containers is quite time consuming, hence this repository contains a Dummy
Dockerfile that simply pulls the upstream container from DockerHub
that was previously build from https://github.com/sneumann/bioc_notebooks
